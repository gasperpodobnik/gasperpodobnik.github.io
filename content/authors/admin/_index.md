I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at the **University of Ljubljana**. As part of my PhD journey, I have undertaken two research internships: one as an _ASEF Junior Fellow_ at the Computer Laboratory, **University of Cambridge** (UK), and another as a _Fulbright Scholar_ at **Johns Hopkins University** (USA), which is currently ongoing. 
My research focuses on medical image analysis, modeling of human anatomy, development of validation metrics, and generative models for synthetic data creation. I am particularly interested in virtual imaging trials, digital patient twins, and their applications in radiotherapy, disease diagnosis, AI tool validation, and the creation of next-generation tools for precision and personalized medicine.
