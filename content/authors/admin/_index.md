      Thesis: [_Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning_](https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=173577&lang=eng).
      Advised by [Prof. Dr. Tomaž Vrtovec](https://lit.fe.uni-lj.si/en/members/tomazv/) and co-advised by [Assoc. Prof. Dr. Bulat Ibragimov](https://bulatibragimov.com/).

      My doctoral research focused on improving the accuracy and clinical reliability of organ-at-risk (OAR) segmentation for radiotherapy planning, particularly in the anatomically complex head and neck region. I investigated the potential and limitations of combining computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) data for this task, addressing challenges such as image registration, modality-specific artifacts, and clinical validation. As part of this work, we developed the [HaN-Seg dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/7442914) - a public paired CT–MR dataset with expert annotations - and organized a [computational challenge](https://han-seg2023.grand-challenge.org/) on multi-modal segmentation. We also designed in-house multi-modal models to explore the integration of CT and MR information. On the validation side, we conducted geometric, dosimetric, and psychometric analyses of organ-at-risk auto-segmentation and introduced [MeshMetrics](https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics), a mesh-based implementation of distance-based metrics for 2D and 3D segmentation evaluation.

I recently earned my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the **University of Ljubljana** (Slovenia). During my doctoral studies, I completed two international research fellowships: as an _ASEF Junior Fellow_ at the Computer Laboratory, **University of Cambridge** (UK), and as a _Fulbright Scholar_ at **Johns Hopkins University** (USA). I am currently transitioning to a new role and am open to new opportunities.

My research focuses on medical image analysis, 3D semantic segmentation, modeling of human anatomy, development of validation metrics, and synthetic data creation. I am particularly interested in virtual imaging trials, digital patient twins, and their applications in radiotherapy, disease diagnosis, AI tool validation, and the creation of next-generation tools for precision and personalized medicine. 

For a full list of my publications, please refer to my [CV](uploads/GasperPodobnik-CV.pdf) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wLYUwqMAAAAJ&hl=sl&oi=ao). Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate! 😃
